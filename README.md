# CSC226 Project

**Term**: Spring 2021

**Author(s)**: Luke Wilson

Ô∏èindicates action items; you should remove these emoji as you complete/update the items which they accompany. (This means that your final README should have no Ô∏èin it!)

**References**: 
Throughout this project, you have likely used outside resources. Reference all ideas which are not your own, and describe how you integrated the ideas or code into your program. This includes online sources, people who have helped you, and any other resources that are not solely your own contribution. Update as you go.

## Milestone 1: Setup, Planning, Design

Ô∏è**Title**: Return to Monke

**Purpose**: This project uses GUIs for a "choose your own adventure game".

**Sources**: T01

**Kanban Board**: https://trello.com/b/XQrg9KAf/choose-your-own-adventure-monke-edition

**CRC Card**:
  - Please write a CRC card for a class that your project will implement.
  - See this link for a sample CRC card and a template to
  use for your own cards (you will have to make a copy to edit): https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JE_3Qmytk_JGztRqkPXWACJwciPH61VCx3idIlBCVFY/edit?usp=sharing
  - Tables in markdown are not easy, so we suggest saving your CRC card
  as an image and including the image(s) in the README. You can do this
  by saving an image in the repository and linking to it. See the sample CRC card below - and replace it with your own.

## Milestone 2: Code

No README action items. Keep your Kanban board up to date, and focus on your code. üôÉ

## Milestone 3: Virtual Check-in

Indicates what percentage of the project you have left to complete, and how confident you are feeling. 

**Completion Percentage**: 99%

**Confidence**: I feel pretty confident that I can complete this project in a well-mannered time frame and be able to debug the program before presentations.

## Milestone 4: Final Code, Presentation, Demo

### User Instructions
To use the program you must click 1 or 2. The 1 key will progress through the story. The 2 key will indicate to the user that they have lost the game. The user must keep hitting the 1 key to win the game. If the user hits the two key a "you lose" screen will pop up, and the window will close. When the user reaches the last stage the window will close.

### Errors and Constraints
The biggest bug of the program is the key handles. For example, if you hit the one key two fast it may mess up the program. It could potentially crash or collide two slides at once. Another bug in the program is in the last slide, it tells you to continue by pressing 1 but if you hit 2 it will take you to the lose screen.

### Reflection
In three to four well-written paragraphs, address the following (at a minimum):
- Why did you select the project that you did?
  
I selected this project because I really like video games and thought a "choose your own adventure" game would be fun. I'm also goofy, so I thought I'd make the game funny and enjoyable. I also chose this project because it will help be become a better game designer if I practice making games. I also learned about how important deadlines are. That's very helpful in the game design industry.
- How closely did your final project reflect your initial design?
  
My final project is better than my initial design. I had time to add new things that were not a part of the original plan. For example, I added pictures and music to my game. I also implemented the program to close the window when you won or lost the game.
- What did you learn from this process?
  
I learned how to use gifs in turtle windows and classes. I learned you could use gifs as shapes for turtle. I learned how to import music/sounds to Python. I learned how important classes were. I learned more about the sys import and winsound import.
- What was the hardest part of the final project?
  
The hardest part about the project was the key handlers. I wanted to implement a design to where you could choose three choices but that would take too long in a short scope of time. I would have needed to make many more methods and functions, but it would take way too long.
- What would you do differently next time, knowing what you know now?

I think I would have added more sound effects to the game. I think I'd also create multiple choices and multiple endings to the game. I should have also taken more to time to possibly animate some things to add more special effects to the game.
