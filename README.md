### User Instructions
To use the program you must click 1 or 2. The 1 key will progress through the story. The 2 key will indicate to the user that they have lost the game. The user must keep hitting the 1 key to win the game. If the user hits the two key a "you lose" screen will pop up, and the window will close. When the user reaches the last stage the window will close.

### Errors and Constraints
The biggest bug of the program is the key handles. For example, if you hit the one key two fast it may mess up the program. It could potentially crash or collide two slides at once. Another bug in the program is in the last slide, it tells you to continue by pressing 1 but if you hit 2 it will take you to the lose screen.

### Reflection
In three to four well-written paragraphs, address the following (at a minimum):
- Why did you select the project that you did?
  
I selected this project because I really like video games and thought a "choose your own adventure" game would be fun. I'm also goofy, so I thought I'd make the game funny and enjoyable. I also chose this project because it will help be become a better game designer if I practice making games. I also learned about how important deadlines are. That's very helpful in the game design industry.
- How closely did your final project reflect your initial design?
  
My final project is better than my initial design. I had time to add new things that were not a part of the original plan. For example, I added pictures and music to my game. I also implemented the program to close the window when you won or lost the game.
- What did you learn from this process?
  
I learned how to use gifs in turtle windows and classes. I learned you could use gifs as shapes for turtle. I learned how to import music/sounds to Python. I learned how important classes were. I learned more about the sys import and winsound import.
- What was the hardest part of the final project?
  
The hardest part about the project was the key handlers. I wanted to implement a design to where you could choose three choices but that would take too long in a short scope of time. I would have needed to make many more methods and functions, but it would take way too long.
- What would you do differently next time, knowing what you know now?

I think I would have added more sound effects to the game. I think I'd also create multiple choices and multiple endings to the game. I should have also taken more to time to possibly animate some things to add more special effects to the game.
